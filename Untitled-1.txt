Most people are able to give blood, but only 1 in 25 people actually do. You can donate blood if you:

are fit and healthy
weigh at least 50kg (7st 12lb)
are 17-66 years old (or 70 if you've given blood before)
are over 70 and have given blood in the last 2 years





  Total Available Blood In All Blood Banks <%
              availableBlood.map((t)=> {%>

              <h3><%=t.units %></h3>
              <% }) %>










              <% for (let bloodGroups in availableBlood ) { %>
              <br />
              <%= bloodGroups['bloodtype'] %> <%# will output the numbers 1-10
              %> <% } %>
